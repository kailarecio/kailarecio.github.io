    subtitle: "Abstract"
    description: |
      The proliferation of political dynasties has led to longstanding concerns over their influence on development.
      For this reason, this study investigates the causal effect of dynastic mayors on economic outcomes by using an exogenous source of variation in their dynastic composition – the term limit policy.
      Using a difference-in-difference strategy, I compare municipalities affected and yet to be affected by term limits before and after coming into effect to isolate its impact on dynastic mayors.
      Instead of eradicating political elites, term limits lead to more dynastic mayors as they adapt to retain power.
      Using the policy to instrument for dynastic mayors, further analysis reveals that municipalities under their purview receive 1.23 million Pesos more national aid – almost thrice the average municipality.
      Inequality remains stark with aid concentrated among high-income municipalities Lastly, I observe no changes in household wealth and education in part due to corruption among local dynasties.
